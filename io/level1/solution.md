# IO Level 1

## Overview

Our program to exploit asks for a 3 digit passcode, and gives us a shell if we can guess it correctly.  With no penalties for incorrect answers, we can simply run through every possibility and check to see if we have access yet.

## Execution

```
$> ./exploit.sh
   passcode: <digits>
$> ./exploit.sh
   Enter the 3 digit passcode to enter: <digits>
root $>
'''
